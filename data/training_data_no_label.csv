Find all rows that show signs of SSH-Patator,SSH-Patator,"An SSH Patator attack is essentially an automated brute-force password-guessing campaign against an SSH service, usually carried out with the “patator” tool, which rapidly cycles through huge lists of usernames and passwords to find a working login and gain unauthorized shell access. In logs and network traffic, common signs include a very high volume of SSH connection attempts in a short period of time, many repeated “failed password” or “invalid user” entries (often across many different usernames, including obvious ones like root, admin, or test), connections from a single suspicious IP (or a small set of IPs) hitting port 22 nonstop, and sometimes attempts that follow a very regular, scripted pattern (e.g., evenly spaced attempts, alphabetically or numerically ordered username lists). On the host, you might also see increased CPU load from the SSH daemon, spikes in authentication-related log entries (/var/log/auth.log, secure, etc.), and—if the attack succeeds—a sudden valid login from an unusual IP followed by new processes being started or changes to user accounts or SSH keys.","CREATE TABLE ids2017 (""Flow ID"" VARCHAR, ""Source IP"" VARCHAR, ""Source Port"" BIGINT, ""Destination IP"" VARCHAR, ""Destination Port"" BIGINT, Protocol BIGINT, Timestamp VARCHAR, ""Flow Duration"" BIGINT, ""Total Fwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Total Backward Packets"" BIGINT, ""Total Length of Fwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Total Length of Bwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packet Length Max"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packet Length Min"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packet Length Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd Packet Length Std"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd Packet Length Max"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Packet Length Min"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Packet Length Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd Packet Length Std"" DOUBLE, ""Flow Bytes/s"" DOUBLE, ""Flow Packets/s"" DOUBLE, ""Flow IAT Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Flow IAT Std"" DOUBLE, ""Flow IAT Max"" BIGINT, ""Flow IAT Min"" BIGINT, ""Fwd IAT Total"" BIGINT, ""Fwd IAT Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd IAT Std"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd IAT Max"" BIGINT, ""Fwd IAT Min"" BIGINT, ""Bwd IAT Total"" BIGINT, ""Bwd IAT Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd IAT Std"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd IAT Max"" BIGINT, ""Bwd IAT Min"" BIGINT, ""Fwd PSH Flags"" BIGINT, ""Bwd PSH Flags"" BIGINT, ""Fwd URG Flags"" BIGINT, ""Bwd URG Flags"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Header Length"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Header Length"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packets/s"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd Packets/s"" DOUBLE, ""Min Packet Length"" BIGINT, ""Max Packet Length"" BIGINT, ""Packet Length Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Packet Length Std"" DOUBLE, ""Packet Length Variance"" DOUBLE, ""FIN Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""SYN Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""RST Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""PSH Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""ACK Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""URG Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""CWE Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""ECE Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""Down/Up Ratio"" BIGINT, ""Average Packet"" Size DOUBLE, ""Avg Fwd Segment Size"" DOUBLE, ""Avg Bwd Segment Size"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd Header Length_1"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Avg Bytes/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Avg Packets/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Avg Bulk Rate"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Avg Bytes/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Avg Packets/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Avg Bulk Rate"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Fwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Fwd Bytes"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Bwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Bwd Bytes"" BIGINT, Init_Win_bytes_forward BIGINT, Init_Win_bytes_backward BIGINT, act_data_pkt_fwd BIGINT, min_seg_size_forward BIGINT, ""Active Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Active Std"" DOUBLE, ""Active Max"" BIGINT, ""Active Min"" BIGINT, ""Idle Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Idle Std"" DOUBLE, ""Idle Max"" BIGINT, ""Idle Min"" BIGINT)",label,5897,3117165
Find all rows that show signs of DoS slowloris,DoS slowloris,"A DoS Slowloris attack is a low-and-slow denial-of-service technique that targets web servers (especially older Apache-style servers) by opening a large number of HTTP connections and then keeping them “alive” as long as possible by sending tiny, incomplete HTTP headers at very slow intervals. Instead of flooding bandwidth, Slowloris exhausts the server’s pool of connection slots so that legitimate users can’t establish new connections, effectively taking the site offline while using relatively little attacker bandwidth. Common signs of a Slowloris attack include a huge number of open, half-finished HTTP connections from one or a few IP addresses, many requests that never complete (no full headers or body), server error logs showing timeouts or “too many open connections,” and symptoms where the server becomes unresponsive to new clients even though CPU and network usage don’t look like a classic high-volume flood.","CREATE TABLE ids2017 (""Flow ID"" VARCHAR, ""Source IP"" VARCHAR, ""Source Port"" BIGINT, ""Destination IP"" VARCHAR, ""Destination Port"" BIGINT, Protocol BIGINT, Timestamp VARCHAR, ""Flow Duration"" BIGINT, ""Total Fwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Total Backward Packets"" BIGINT, ""Total Length of Fwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Total Length of Bwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packet Length Max"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packet Length Min"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packet Length Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd Packet Length Std"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd Packet Length Max"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Packet Length Min"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Packet Length Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd Packet Length Std"" DOUBLE, ""Flow Bytes/s"" DOUBLE, ""Flow Packets/s"" DOUBLE, ""Flow IAT Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Flow IAT Std"" DOUBLE, ""Flow IAT Max"" BIGINT, ""Flow IAT Min"" BIGINT, ""Fwd IAT Total"" BIGINT, ""Fwd IAT Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd IAT Std"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd IAT Max"" BIGINT, ""Fwd IAT Min"" BIGINT, ""Bwd IAT Total"" BIGINT, ""Bwd IAT Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd IAT Std"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd IAT Max"" BIGINT, ""Bwd IAT Min"" BIGINT, ""Fwd PSH Flags"" BIGINT, ""Bwd PSH Flags"" BIGINT, ""Fwd URG Flags"" BIGINT, ""Bwd URG Flags"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Header Length"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Header Length"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packets/s"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd Packets/s"" DOUBLE, ""Min Packet Length"" BIGINT, ""Max Packet Length"" BIGINT, ""Packet Length Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Packet Length Std"" DOUBLE, ""Packet Length Variance"" DOUBLE, ""FIN Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""SYN Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""RST Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""PSH Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""ACK Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""URG Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""CWE Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""ECE Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""Down/Up Ratio"" BIGINT, ""Average Packet"" Size DOUBLE, ""Avg Fwd Segment Size"" DOUBLE, ""Avg Bwd Segment Size"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd Header Length_1"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Avg Bytes/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Avg Packets/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Avg Bulk Rate"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Avg Bytes/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Avg Packets/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Avg Bulk Rate"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Fwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Fwd Bytes"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Bwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Bwd Bytes"" BIGINT, Init_Win_bytes_forward BIGINT, Init_Win_bytes_backward BIGINT, act_data_pkt_fwd BIGINT, min_seg_size_forward BIGINT, ""Active Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Active Std"" DOUBLE, ""Active Max"" BIGINT, ""Active Min"" BIGINT, ""Idle Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Idle Std"" DOUBLE, ""Idle Max"" BIGINT, ""Idle Min"" BIGINT)",label,5796,3117165

Instead of one machine attacking you, it’s hundreds or thousands acting in coordination.

Common signs of a portscan include a large number of connection attempts from a single IP (or small group of IPs) to many different ports in a short time, repeated attempts that don’t follow normal user behavior (e.g., sequential port numbers, or connections to unusual high ports), lots of half-open TCP connections (SYNs without full handshakes), and IDS/IPS alerts flagging known scan patterns such as SYN scans, FIN scans, or NULL/Xmas scans.

Find all rows that show signs of Heartbleed,Heartbleed,"A Heartbleed attack exploits a famous vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160) in certain versions of OpenSSL’s TLS “heartbeat” extension, where a client can claim it is sending a chunk of data of a certain length but actually send much less, and the server responds by echoing back that claimed length—pulling extra bytes straight from its own memory. This lets an attacker repeatedly siphon small chunks of RAM from a vulnerable server, potentially exposing highly sensitive data like usernames/passwords, session cookies, private keys, or other in-memory secrets without leaving obvious traces. Common signs of a Heartbleed attack are mostly visible in network and IDS logs rather than to end users: an unusual volume of TLS heartbeat requests, especially with suspicious or mismatched payload/length fields; IDS/IPS alerts for Heartbleed signatures; and, after the fact, unexplained credential compromises or certificates that appear to be stolen and abused. However, a key challenge is that Heartbleed attacks are often “quiet,” leaving little direct evidence on the host beyond this odd heartbeat traffic.","CREATE TABLE ids2017 (""Flow ID"" VARCHAR, ""Source IP"" VARCHAR, ""Source Port"" BIGINT, ""Destination IP"" VARCHAR, ""Destination Port"" BIGINT, Protocol BIGINT, Timestamp VARCHAR, ""Flow Duration"" BIGINT, ""Total Fwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Total Backward Packets"" BIGINT, ""Total Length of Fwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Total Length of Bwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packet Length Max"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packet Length Min"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packet Length Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd Packet Length Std"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd Packet Length Max"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Packet Length Min"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Packet Length Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd Packet Length Std"" DOUBLE, ""Flow Bytes/s"" DOUBLE, ""Flow Packets/s"" DOUBLE, ""Flow IAT Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Flow IAT Std"" DOUBLE, ""Flow IAT Max"" BIGINT, ""Flow IAT Min"" BIGINT, ""Fwd IAT Total"" BIGINT, ""Fwd IAT Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd IAT Std"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd IAT Max"" BIGINT, ""Fwd IAT Min"" BIGINT, ""Bwd IAT Total"" BIGINT, ""Bwd IAT Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd IAT Std"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd IAT Max"" BIGINT, ""Bwd IAT Min"" BIGINT, ""Fwd PSH Flags"" BIGINT, ""Bwd PSH Flags"" BIGINT, ""Fwd URG Flags"" BIGINT, ""Bwd URG Flags"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Header Length"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Header Length"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Packets/s"" DOUBLE, ""Bwd Packets/s"" DOUBLE, ""Min Packet Length"" BIGINT, ""Max Packet Length"" BIGINT, ""Packet Length Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Packet Length Std"" DOUBLE, ""Packet Length Variance"" DOUBLE, ""FIN Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""SYN Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""RST Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""PSH Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""ACK Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""URG Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""CWE Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""ECE Flag Count"" BIGINT, ""Down/Up Ratio"" BIGINT, ""Average Packet"" Size DOUBLE, ""Avg Fwd Segment Size"" DOUBLE, ""Avg Bwd Segment Size"" DOUBLE, ""Fwd Header Length_1"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Avg Bytes/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Avg Packets/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Fwd Avg Bulk Rate"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Avg Bytes/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Avg Packets/Bulk"" BIGINT, ""Bwd Avg Bulk Rate"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Fwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Fwd Bytes"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Bwd Packets"" BIGINT, ""Subflow Bwd Bytes"" BIGINT, Init_Win_bytes_forward BIGINT, Init_Win_bytes_backward BIGINT, act_data_pkt_fwd BIGINT, min_seg_size_forward BIGINT, ""Active Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Active Std"" DOUBLE, ""Active Max"" BIGINT, ""Active Min"" BIGINT, ""Idle Mean"" DOUBLE, ""Idle Std"" DOUBLE, ""Idle Max"" BIGINT, ""Idle Min"" BIGINT)",label,11,3117165
