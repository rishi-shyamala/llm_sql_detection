"An SSH Patator attack is essentially an automated brute-force password-guessing campaign against an SSH service, usually carried out with the “patator” tool, which rapidly cycles through huge lists of usernames and passwords to find a working login and gain unauthorized shell access. In logs and network traffic, common signs include a very high volume of SSH connection attempts in a short period of time, many repeated “failed password” or “invalid user” entries (often across many different usernames, including obvious ones like root, admin, or test), connections from a single suspicious IP (or a small set of IPs) hitting port 22 nonstop, and sometimes attempts that follow a very regular, scripted pattern (e.g., evenly spaced attempts, alphabetically or numerically ordered username lists). On the host, you might also see increased CPU load from the SSH daemon, spikes in authentication-related log entries (/var/log/auth.log, secure, etc.), and—if the attack succeeds—a sudden valid login from an unusual IP followed by new processes being started or changes to user accounts or SSH keys.
Give me 4 different duckdb sql compatible queries that will find all rows that show signs of the SSH-Patator attack in the table. You may use any valid duckdb sql functions and must include all columns in the output. Do not include any text in the output except for the 4 queries.

"A DoS Slowloris attack is a low-and-slow denial-of-service technique that targets web servers (especially older Apache-style servers) by opening a large number of HTTP connections and then keeping them “alive” as long as possible by sending tiny, incomplete HTTP headers at very slow intervals. Instead of flooding bandwidth, Slowloris exhausts the server’s pool of connection slots so that legitimate users can’t establish new connections, effectively taking the site offline while using relatively little attacker bandwidth. Common signs of a Slowloris attack include a huge number of open, half-finished HTTP connections from one or a few IP addresses, many requests that never complete (no full headers or body), server error logs showing timeouts or “too many open connections,” and symptoms where the server becomes unresponsive to new clients even though CPU and network usage don’t look like a classic high-volume flood.

"A DoS Slowloris attack is a low-and-slow denial-of-service technique that targets web servers (especially older Apache-style servers) by opening a large number of HTTP connections and then keeping them “alive” as long as possible by sending tiny, incomplete HTTP headers at very slow intervals. Instead of flooding bandwidth, Slowloris exhausts the server’s pool of connection slots so that legitimate users can’t establish new connections, effectively taking the site offline while using relatively little attacker bandwidth. Common signs of a Slowloris attack include a huge number of open, half-finished HTTP connections from one or a few IP addresses, many requests that never complete (no full headers or body), server error logs showing timeouts or “too many open connections,” and symptoms where the server becomes unresponsive to new clients even though CPU and network usage don’t look like a classic high-volume flood.

"A botnet attack is when an attacker controls a large network of compromised devices (bots)—like infected PCs, servers, or even IoT gadgets—and uses them together to carry out malicious actions, such as DDoS attacks, credential stuffing, spam campaigns, or large-scale scanning, often without the owners’ knowledge. Instead of one machine attacking you, it’s hundreds or thousands acting in coordination. Common signs of a botnet attack include sudden spikes in incoming traffic from many different IP addresses (often globally distributed), unusual patterns like identical requests from many sources, services becoming slow or unavailable without a clear legitimate traffic spike, outbound connections from your own hosts to strange domains or IPs (command-and-control servers), unexpected increases in bandwidth or CPU usage on endpoints, and security tools flagging connections or behavior that match known botnet infrastructure or malware signatures.

"An FTP Patator attack is an automated brute-force attack against an FTP server, typically carried out using the “patator” tool, which rapidly cycles through many username–password combinations to find valid credentials and gain unauthorized access to files. Instead of a few mistaken logins, Patator hammers the FTP service with systematic, script-driven attempts. Common signs include a high volume of failed login attempts in a short time window, many 530 Login incorrect or similar errors in FTP logs, repeated attempts against common usernames like ftp, admin, user, or random-looking usernames, and a large number of connection attempts to port 21 from a single IP or a small set of IPs. You might also see evenly spaced or very regular login attempts (indicating automation), increased load on the FTP service, and—if the attack succeeds—suspicious successful logins followed by unusual file listing, upload, download, or deletion activity.

"An FTP Patator attack is an automated brute-force attack against an FTP server, typically carried out using the “patator” tool, which rapidly cycles through many username–password combinations to find valid credentials and gain unauthorized access to files. Instead of a few mistaken logins, Patator hammers the FTP service with systematic, script-driven attempts. Common signs include a high volume of failed login attempts in a short time window, many 530 Login incorrect or similar errors in FTP logs, repeated attempts against common usernames like ftp, admin, user, or random-looking usernames, and a large number of connection attempts to port 21 from a single IP or a small set of IPs. You might also see evenly spaced or very regular login attempts (indicating automation), increased load on the FTP service, and—if the attack succeeds—suspicious successful logins followed by unusual file listing, upload, download, or deletion activity. Give me 4 different duckdb sql compatible queries that will find all rows that show signs of the FTP patator attack in the table.

"A DoS Slowhttptest attack is a “slow HTTP” denial-of-service attack (often generated with the slowhttptest tool) that targets web servers by opening many HTTP connections and then sending the request data extremely slowly, so each connection stays open and ties up server resources without needing much bandwidth from the attacker.

"A DoS Slowhttptest attack is a “slow HTTP” denial-of-service attack (often generated with the slowhttptest tool) that targets web servers by opening many HTTP connections and then sending the request data extremely slowly, so each connection stays open and ties up server resources without needing much bandwidth from the attacker. Instead of blasting traffic, it exhausts the server’s concurrent connection or thread pool, preventing it from handling real users. Common signs of a Slowhttptest-style attack include a very high number of active HTTP connections in a “reading request” or “waiting for body” state, many requests that never complete or take an abnormally long time to finish, lots of partial or incomplete HTTP headers or bodies in logs, clients that send data at very low, consistent rates, and a web server that becomes sluggish or stops responding to new connections even though CPU and overall bandwidth usage may look relatively normal compared to classic volumetric DoS attacks. Give me 4 different duckdb sql compatible queries that will find all rows that show signs of the DoS httpslowtest attack in the table. You may use any valid duckdb sql functions and must include all columns in the output. Do not include any text in the output except for the 4 queries.

"A network infiltration attack is when an attacker quietly slips into an organization’s internal network—often by exploiting a vulnerability, stealing credentials, or tricking a user with phishing—and then moves around inside to spy, steal data, or position themselves for a bigger attack, all while trying not to be detected.

"A DoS GoldenEye attack is an application-layer denial-of-service attack generated with the “GoldenEye” tool, which aggressively floods a web server with HTTP requests (usually GET/POST) while abusing features like keep-alive, randomized headers, and concurrent threads to exhaust the server’s connection and worker pools. Instead of just saturating raw bandwidth, GoldenEye aims to tie up the web server itself so it can’t respond to legitimate users. Common signs include a sudden spike in HTTP traffic to ports 80/443 from one or a small set of IPs, large numbers of simultaneous connections in states like “reading” or “waiting,” many repeated requests to the same URLs with varied User-Agents or referrers, web server logs full of similar requests at very high frequency, increasing response times and 5xx errors (e.g., 503 Service Unavailable), and high CPU or thread usage on the web server even though overall network bandwidth may not look like a typical volumetric DDoS flood.

"A DoS GoldenEye attack is an application-layer denial-of-service attack generated with the “GoldenEye” tool, which aggressively floods a web server with HTTP requests (usually GET/POST) while abusing features like keep-alive, randomized headers, and concurrent threads to exhaust the server’s connection and worker pools.

"A portscan attack is a reconnaissance technique where an attacker systematically probes a host or network to see which ports are open and what services are listening, so they can later target specific vulnerabilities rather than attacking blindly. Instead of trying to break in immediately, the attacker sends many connection attempts (often SYN packets) to a range of ports and observes which ones respond. Common signs of a portscan include a large number of connection attempts from a single IP (or small group of IPs) to many different ports in a short time, repeated attempts that don’t follow normal user behavior (e.g., sequential port numbers, or connections to unusual high ports), lots of half-open TCP connections (SYNs without full handshakes), and IDS/IPS alerts flagging known scan patterns such as SYN scans, FIN scans, or NULL/Xmas scans. You might also see scans focused on specific ports tied to high-value services (SSH 22, RDP 3389, databases, web admin ports, etc.), especially if those ports are not normally accessed by typical users. Give me 4 different duckdb sql compatible queries that will find all rows that show signs of the Portscan attack in the table. You may use any valid duckdb sql functions and must include all columns in the output. Do not include any text in the output except for the 4 queries.

"A Heartbleed attack exploits a famous vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160) in certain versions of OpenSSL’s TLS “heartbeat” extension, where a client can claim it is sending a chunk of data of a certain length but actually send much less, and the server responds by echoing back that claimed length—pulling extra bytes straight from its own memory.

Common signs of a Heartbleed attack are mostly visible in network and IDS logs rather than to end users: an unusual volume of TLS heartbeat requests, especially with suspicious or mismatched payload/length fields; IDS/IPS alerts for Heartbleed signatures; and, after the fact, unexplained credential compromises or certificates that appear to be stolen and abused. However, a key challenge is that Heartbleed attacks are often “quiet,” leaving little direct evidence on the host beyond this odd heartbeat traffic.

"A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is when an attacker uses many machines at once—often a large botnet of compromised computers, servers, or IoT devices—to overwhelm a target website, server, or network so that legitimate users can’t access it. Instead of a single source flooding you, traffic comes from hundreds or thousands of IPs acting in coordination, making it harder to block with simple IP-based filters. Common signs of a DDoS attack include a sudden surge in traffic from many geographically dispersed or otherwise unrelated IP addresses, services becoming extremely slow or timing out, large spikes in bandwidth usage or in the number of concurrent connections, unusual traffic patterns (e.g., many identical requests to the same endpoint), routers or firewalls hitting connection or CPU limits, and alerts from monitoring/IDS tools about volumetric floods, protocol anomalies, or application-layer request storms that don’t match normal user behavior or expected traffic spikes.

"A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is when an attacker uses many machines at once—often a large botnet of compromised computers, servers, or IoT devices—to overwhelm a target website, server, or network so that legitimate users can’t access it. Instead of a single source flooding you, traffic comes from hundreds or thousands of IPs acting in coordination, making it harder to block with simple IP-based filters. Common signs of a DDoS attack include a sudden surge in traffic from many geographically dispersed or otherwise unrelated IP addresses, services becoming extremely slow or timing out, large spikes in bandwidth usage or in the number of concurrent connections, unusual traffic patterns (e.g., many identical requests to the same endpoint), routers or firewalls hitting connection or CPU limits, and alerts from monitoring/IDS tools about volumetric floods, protocol anomalies, or application-layer request storms that don’t match normal user behavior or expected traffic spikes. Give me 4 different duckdb sql compatible queries that will find all rows that show signs of the DDoS attack in the table. You may use any valid duckdb sql functions and must include all columns in the output. Do not include any text in the output except for the 4 queries.

"A DoS (Denial of Service) attack is when an attacker tries to make a system, website, or network service unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming it with traffic or resource-consuming requests, so it can’t respond properly anymore. Instead of sneaking in, the attacker’s goal is to disrupt availability—by exhausting bandwidth, CPU, memory, or connection slots. Common signs of a DoS attack include sudden and sustained spikes in traffic, services becoming very slow or completely unresponsive, unusually high numbers of connections or requests from one IP or a small set of IPs, error messages like “service unavailable” or timeouts for normal users, and network or system monitoring tools showing resource exhaustion (maxed-out CPU, bandwidth, or connection tables) without a legitimate reason such as a planned marketing event or expected traffic surge.

Okiru: The Okiru botnet is a variant of Mirai designed primarily to compromise Internet of Things (IoT) devices—especially those using specific ARC CPU architectures—by exploiting weak/default credentials and known vulnerabilities, then enrolling them into a large distributed network that can be used for powerful DDoS attacks. Once devices are infected, they typically connect out to a command-and-control (C2) server to receive instructions for which targets to flood and what attack methods to use (e.g., TCP/UDP floods).
